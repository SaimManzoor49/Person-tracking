## Introduction

This project implements a robust and intelligent **Multi-Camera Person Re-identification (ReID) System**. Its primary goal is to automatically track and assign consistent identities to individuals as they move across multiple non-overlapping camera views. This addresses the significant challenge of manually monitoring large surveillance networks, providing a powerful solution for security, investigation, and smart city applications.

The system leverages state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, including object detection, tracking, advanced feature extraction, and re-identification algorithms, to maintain a single identity for a person regardless of their appearance changes due to varying camera angles, lighting, or pose.

## Key Features

  * **Multi-Camera Tracking:** Seamlessly tracks individuals across different camera feeds.
  * **Consistent ID Assignment:** Maintains a unique identity for each person throughout the surveillance network.
  * **Robust Re-identification:** Employs advanced techniques (like segmentation masks and feature clustering) to handle variations in pose, lighting, and occlusions.
  * **Real-time Processing:** Designed for efficient real-time operation using optimized models.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.
  * Pip (Python package installer) installed.
  * A powerful GPU is highly recommended for optimal performance, especially for real-time processing and multi-camera streams.

### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Creating and activating a virtual environment ensures dependencies are managed cleanly and don't conflict with other Python projects on your system. Follow the steps for your operating system:

#### Windows

1.  Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2.  Run the following commands:
    ```cmd
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

#### Mac/Linux

1.  Open a terminal.
2.  Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1.  Ensure the virtual environment is activated (`(venv)` should appear in your terminal prompt).
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project where `requirements.txt` is located.
3.  Run the following command to install all required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Configure Models or Video Sources

Before running the project, you might need to specify paths to pre-trained models or your video input sources.

1.  Open the main configuration files (e.g., `config.py`, or directly within `main.py` if settings are inline).
2.  Adjust the paths to:
      * **Models:** Specify the location of pre-trained YOLOv8, OSNet-IBN, or any other required model weights.
      * **Video Sources:** Point to your input video files or camera streams (e.g., webcam IDs, RTSP URLs).
      * **Other Settings:** Customize parameters like confidence thresholds, tracking parameters, or output directories as required for your specific use case.

### Step 4: Run the Project

After completing the above setup and configuration steps, you can start the project.

1.  Ensure your virtual environment (`venv`) is activated.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Execute the main script:
    ```cmd
    python main.py
    ```

## Understanding the Project

This project aims to solve the problem of **person re-identification** across multiple, non-overlapping camera views. It employs a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Detection:** Uses **YOLOv8** to accurately detect individuals in each video frame, drawing a bounding box around them.
2.  **Tracking:** Within a single camera's view, individuals are tracked using algorithms like **ByteTrack**, ensuring a consistent temporary ID.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** A unique "digital fingerprint" (feature vector) of each person's appearance is created using models like **OSNet-IBN**. This process is enhanced by **instance segmentation masks** (from YOLO Seg) to remove background noise and improve accuracy.
4.  **Re-Identification (Matching):** These "digital fingerprints" are compared across cameras using **cosine similarity**. Techniques like **feature clustering** and extended track memory are used to ensure stable and accurate re-identification, assigning the same global ID to a person no matter which camera they appear on.

## Notes

  * If you encounter any issues, double-check that the virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are correctly installed.
  * For specific configuration changes, refer to the inline comments within the Python scripts.
  * The performance of the system is heavily dependent on the hardware, particularly the GPU.
